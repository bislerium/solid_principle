# SOLID Principle

The SOLID principle is a set of design principles widely utilized in object-oriented programming to enhance code maintainability and flexibility. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are considered fundamental guidelines for writing clean and efficient code.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, emphasizing that each class should focus on a single responsibility or job. This promotes modularity and improves code understanding.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages the addition of new functionality without altering existing code, often achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Subclasses should be interchangeable with their superclasses.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests having multiple small, specific interfaces instead of a large, general one to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control for a more flexible and decoupled design.

Applying these SOLID principles can lead to code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They are valuable guidelines for creating robust and scalable software in object-oriented programming paradigms.
