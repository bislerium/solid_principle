# SOLID Principle

The SOLID principle is a set of five design principles widely used in object-oriented programming to enhance the maintainability, flexibility, and scalability of software. These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, serve as fundamental guidelines for writing clean and efficient code. The SOLID acronym represents:

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, indicating that it should have a single responsibility or job. This principle encourages modularity, where a class focuses on performing one task well, leading to more understandable and maintainable code.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle promotes the ability to add new functionality without altering existing code, often achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a class is a subclass of another class, it should be interchangeable with its superclass without causing issues.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests having multiple small, specific interfaces instead of a large, general one to avoid the problems associated with "fat" interfaces, where implementing classes are obligated to provide unnecessary methods.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; instead, details should depend on abstractions. This principle advocates for dependency injection and inversion of control to achieve a more flexible and decoupled design.

Applying these SOLID principles leads to code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They are valuable guidelines for creating robust and scalable software in object-oriented programming paradigms.
