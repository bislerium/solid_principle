# Solution Explanation: Electronic Device Interfaces

In the given problem scenario of electronic devices, the solution involves adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by introducing more specific interfaces for different functionalities. The goal is to create interfaces that are tailored to the specific needs of each electronic device class, avoiding the forced implementation of unnecessary methods.

**1. Base Interface (`IElectronicDevice`):**

- This interface contains fundamental methods that are common to all electronic devices, such as `PowerOn` and `PowerOff`. It defines the basic behavior expected from any electronic device.

**2. Specific Interfaces (`IAudioPlayable` and `IVideoPlayable`):**

- Instead of modifying the existing `IElectronicDevice` interface, more specific interfaces are introduced to address the diverse functionalities of electronic devices. These interfaces, `IAudioPlayable` and `IVideoPlayable`, represent the ability to play and pause audio and video content, respectively.

**3. Separation of Concerns:**

- The `IElectronicDevice` interface focuses on power-related functionalities that are common to all devices, promoting a clear separation of concerns. This ensures that every electronic device class adheres to a common power-related contract.

**4. Tailored Functionality Interfaces:**

- Each electronic device class implements only the interfaces relevant to its functionality. For example, the `Television` class implements `IVideoPlayable` because it can play and pause video content. Similarly, the `MusicPlayer` class implements `IAudioPlayable` for playing and pausing audio content.

**5. Avoidance of Unnecessary Methods:**

- The `SmartDoorbell` class, representing a device without video or audio playback capabilities, does not implement the unnecessary `Play` and `Pause` methods. This aligns with the Interface Segregation Principle, preventing the inclusion of methods that are not applicable to the device.

**6. Clearer Contracts:**

- Each interface provides a clearer contract for the classes that implement them. This clarity simplifies the understanding of the expected behavior for each type of electronic device, making the system more maintainable and adaptable.

In summary, the solution focuses on creating interfaces that capture specific functionalities without imposing unnecessary methods on classes. This approach adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle, resulting in a more modular, maintainable, and flexible design for electronic devices. Each class implements only the interfaces relevant to its capabilities, promoting a more cohesive and intuitive system.
