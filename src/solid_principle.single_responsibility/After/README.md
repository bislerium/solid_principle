# In this refactored example:

1. **Document Class**

    The `Document` class now exclusively holds data related to a document, such as its title and content. It no longer contains methods responsible for saving, printing, or converting to PDF, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

2. **DocumentSaver Class**

    The `DocumentSaver` class has the responsibility of saving a `Document` to a file. It encapsulates the logic for saving to a file, providing a clear and focused responsibility.

3. **DocumentPrinter Class**

    The `DocumentPrinter` class handles the logic for printing a `Document`. It has a single responsibility and is separate from the `Document` class.

4. **PDFConverter Class**

    The `PDFConverter` class is responsible for converting a `Document` to PDF. Similar to the other classes, it has a single responsibility and encapsulates the logic for PDF conversion.

## Benefits and Implications

- **Modularity:** Each class has a clear and distinct responsibility, promoting modularity in the codebase. This makes it easier to understand, modify, and extend the system.

- **Maintainability:** Changes to one aspect of the document management system, such as saving to a file, won't impact other functionalities like printing or PDF conversion. This improves maintainability by reducing the risk of unintended side effects.

- **Readability:** The code is more readable and follows a natural structure. Developers can easily identify where specific functionalities are implemented without unnecessary complexity.

- **Flexibility:** The separation of responsibilities provides flexibility. If, for instance, there's a need to change the way documents are printed, only the `DocumentPrinter` class needs modification, leaving other parts of the system unaffected.

In summary, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle in this example results in a more organized, maintainable, and extensible document management system, where each class excels in its designated responsibility.
